            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>From as far back as I can remember, I've had a keen interest in computers and how they worked. In my school, we had a very large computer that I used almost every
            day; then I slumped over my grandfather's computer before I went home. Eventually, I was introduced to the world of gaming when my father brought home an original XBOX (that we played together alot). Years past and my simple interest turned into a burning passion and a need to learn more about the 'behind the stage' of computers.</p>
            <p>And now in the present, I have begun my journey into front-end web design and continue to learn new things every day. This very website is one of few that I have made from scratch. In the future, I hope to complete my A-Levels and attend Queen's College, Cambridge to persue the beginning of my masters degree, and hopefully, my PhD in Computer Science. However, I am very passionate about science and theoretical mathematics too, so integrating them, in some way, would be my life-long dream. Enjoy my new portfolio!</p>
